Universal Navigation Components (Floating Bottom Bar & Side Drawer)
AI Agent, your task is to build the two universal navigation components: the Floating Bottom Navigation Bar (4 links) and the Side Drawer menu, ensuring a professional look and using icons relevant to a bus ticketing platform.

Read the "Flutter App Development Workflow" summary first. Strictly adhere to the UI Style Mandate (smaller sizes/fonts, use existing theme/widgets).

Part A: Custom Floating Bottom Navigation Bar (custom_bottom_nav_bar.dart)
This component must be a floating navigation bar and dynamically hide/show based on user scrolling.

File Path: lib/widgets/custom_bottom_nav_bar.dart.

Create a custom StatefulWidget (as it will manage visibility state) named CustomBottomNavBar that accepts a ScrollController as a required parameter in its constructor.

Implement logic that makes the bar slide down/fade out when the user scrolls down (hiding it) and slide up/fade back in when the user scrolls up (showing it).

Define the four mandatory tabs with professional and relevant icons in this specific order:

Home/Book Trip: Icon: DirectionsBus or Search. This item should navigate to HomeScreen() upon tap.

My Tickets: Icon: ConfirmationNumber or Receipt (based on the tickets table).

Luggage: Icon: Luggage or Case (based on the luggage table).

Profile: Icon: Person (MUST be the rightmost item on the bar).

The bar must look professional and compact, inheriting colors and style from lib/theme/app_theme.dart. Use placeholder onTap logic that handles navigation for each of the four links.

Part B: Custom Side Drawer (custom_side_drawer.dart)
This component will hold secondary links and administrative functions, accessible from the HomeScreen.

File Path: lib/widgets/custom_side_drawer.dart.

Create a custom StatelessWidget named CustomSideDrawer that returns a Drawer.

Include a simple DrawerHeader with a placeholder user name/logo.

Define a vertical list of ListTile widgets for the sidebar menu. Include:

Agent Management: Icon: People (based on the agents table).

Cancellations: Icon: Close or Cancel (based on the cancels table).

About Us: Icon: Info (based on the abouts table).

Logout: Icon: ExitToApp.

Use placeholder onTap logic for each ListTile and ensure the styling matches the app's theme.
